      <h2>GV60</h2>
      <img src="images/GV60.png" width="30%">
      <p>Genesis unveiled the GV60 on 19 August 2021; it was released globally on 30 September 2021. Codenamed JW during development, the vehicle sits on a dedicated EV platform shared by the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6. Powertrain details include a single-motor application for lower trim levels as well as a dual-motor all-wheel-drive model.</p>
      <p>The GV60 is the first to apply a new Genesis emblem imprinted with an elaborate Guilloche pattern and a clamshell hood that removes joints between the bodies. Also, the GV60 is equipped with Face Connect which recognizes the driver's face to control the door lock, seat, steering wheel, side mirrors, and infotainment. A smartphone-based digital key can be used to open the door of the vehicle and start the engine. This can be used through wireless software updates.</p>
