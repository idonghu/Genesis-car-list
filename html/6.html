      <p>The Genesis G90 is a full-size car manufactured since 2015 by the South Korean company Genesis, the luxury division of Hyundai Motor Company. A four-door sedan, the G90 is the successor of the Hyundai Equus and was known as the Genesis EQ900 in South Korea from 2015 to 2019.</p>
      <p>The exterior design was unveiled on November 30, 2021. Genesis' family look, a two-line lamp was applied. The cube-shaped projection light incorporates a white light, a daytime driving light, and a direction indicator light. Two rows of rear lamps are also long on the back. The second-generation G90 was released in two models: a general model and a long-wheelbase model. Power comes from a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 with 380 PS (279 kW; 375 hp) and 54 kg⋅m (530 N⋅m; 391 lbf⋅ft) in the base car. The long-wheelbase model is further supported by a 48-volt mild hybrid system with an electric supercharger for additional power. All-wheel drive is standard on the long-wheelbase model.</p>
