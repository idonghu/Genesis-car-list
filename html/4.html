      <p>The Genesis G80 (Korean: 제네시스 G80) is an executive sedan manufactured by South Korean luxury marque Genesis, which is owned by Hyundai Motor Company. The G80 model was previously introduced as the second-generation Hyundai Genesis model (DH) and then rebranded as the G80 in 2016 after Genesis Motor was established as a separate luxury division of Hyundai.</p>
      <p>The design language of the Genesis includes quad-headlamps, and a large crest grille. The side profile features a parabolic line, and a fastback-type side view. The rear uses taillamp styling similar to the headlamps. The vehicle features Nappa leather seats. The vehicle also continues using Open Pore wood trim and has slim air conditioning vents. The horizontal layout of the dashboard was inspired by what the brand calls “Beauty of White Space”, which is Genesis’ interior styling design that is made to give the vehicle a "South Korean feel". There is also a glass covered SBW (shift-by-wire) transmission.</p>
